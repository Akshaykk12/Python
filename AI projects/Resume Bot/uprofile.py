    1)Dr. D. Y. Patil Institute of Technology, BTech in Artificial Intelligence and Data
    Science, GPA: 8.3
    2021- Present
    • Coursework: Computer Architecture, Artificial Intelligence, Comparison of Learning Algorithms, Computational
    Theory
    2)Sangmeshwar College, 12th MSBSHSE, Percentage: 91.67 2019- 2021
    • Coursework: Statistics, Algebra, Quantum Physics, etc.

    Projects=
    1)Avalanche Watch
    • AvalancheWatch is an unofficial implementation of the research paper "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
    Monitoring of Avalanche Activity: An Automated Detection Scheme" by H. Vickers, M. Eckerstorfer, E. Malnes,
    and A. Doulgeris.
    • This project aims to replicate the results of the paper, demonstrating an advanced algorithm for detecting snow
    avalanches using SAR technology, which operates effectively regardless of light and weather conditions.

    2)Dental App
    • Integrated Voice to Text transcription into the app using python programming language.
    • Conducted thorough user research by interviewing dentists and administrators to understand their workflow
    and data management challenges. Collected feedback on their needs and preferences to ensure the app met
    their specific requirements.

    3)Face Swapper App
    • The Face Swapper project is a fun and creative application that takes two images as input and produces a single
    output image.
    • The goal of the project is to swap the faces of the individuals in the input images, creating a humorous and
    entertaining result.

    Worked on total of 10+ projects
